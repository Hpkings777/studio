# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Using AI Features

This application uses the Gemini API to power its AI features. To enable them, you'll need to provide your own API key:

1.  Get an API key from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2.  Open the `.env` file in the project.
3.  Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with the key you just created.

Your app's AI features should now be enabled.
